# flexPractice
Practices of using `display:flex;` (all ideas are created by another on from Youtube)
# important Notes:
### `Flex-direction:column;`
- Adds column as the main axis
- Making align-items: horizontal movement;
- AND Justify-content: vertical movement
### Also:
- You can `display:flex;` inside the tag to move and/or *center* the text/ node within
- you can even use classNameOrElement:nth-type-of(#) and align-items(instead of align-self) to move a particular text to be different from other text
