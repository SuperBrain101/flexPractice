Practices of using `display:flex;` (all ideas are created by another on from Youtube)
### How to use display flex:
- write `Display:flex;` This will make anything inside (either children or text) to become easily moveable and aligned
- Row is the default and with the default:
- justify-content: --moves the items horizontally
- align-self:  -- moves the items vertically
- and if you write `align-self:` --you can move a specified item so it can be moved differently from the rest

## Flex-wrap
### Use `flex-wrap:wrap;` 
- for responsiveness and...
- to ensure that the items move to a new line if the size can't fit webpage(so it doesn't make the size smaller instead)
## Order
### use `order:#;`
- When you want to switch items...
- it's kinda like picking the item like :nth-of-type(#) and then that number becomes whatever has the order feautre in the items
  ### for example:
  - /* First elemnt of class .items using :nth-of-type()*/
-  ` .item:nth-of-type(1){
  /*Now we want the first item to become the third item, so pretty much the first item will have a blue background and will become the third item (use with a FLEX ITEM ONLY)/*






# Where I have practiced so far:
- [understanding display: flex ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA&t=601s)
  order:3;
  }`

-  `.item:nth-of-type(3){
  background-color:blue;
  }`
