Practices of using `display:flex;` (all ideas are created by another on from Youtube)
### How to use display flex:
- write `Display:flex;` This will make anything inside (either children or text) to become easily moveable and aligned
- Row is the default and with the default:
- justify-content: --moves the items horizontally
- align-self:  -- moves the items vertically
- and if you write `align-self:` --you can move a specified item so it can be moved differently from the rest
